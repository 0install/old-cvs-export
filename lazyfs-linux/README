You will need:

- A C compiler (eg, gcc).
- Headers for your kernel (Linux 2.4 or 2.6).

To install lazyfs:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install

Then install zero install from:

Technical details about the design of the system can be found in the
zero-install package (see the 'Technical' file).
