<h2>The Injector</h2>

<p>
A running process is created by combining many different libraries (and other components).
In the Zero Install world, we have all versions of each library available at
all times. The problem then is how to choose which versions to use.
</p>

<p>
The injector solves this problem by selecting components to meet a program's requirements,
according to rules specified by the user:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="569" height="364" src="inject.png"
     alt="The injector selects versions according to the user's policy" />
</p>

<h2>Trying it out</h2>

<p>
To use the injector, you will need:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> (version 2.3 or later).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> (to check the digital signatures).</li>
<li><a href="http://0install.net/public_key.gpg">My GPG key</a>. You can download and import
it with:
<pre>
$ gpg --recv-key --keyserver www.keyserver.net 59A53CC1
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<div class='note'>The current release (0.7) is a developer release. It may
contain a few bugs.</div>

<p>
Note that the injector works without needing the Zero Install filesystem to be
installed (you can think of it as the next version of Zero Install).
</p>

<h3>Installing the injector</h3>
<p>
Download the injector from <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76468&amp;package_id=146899">the
download page</a>, or using wget:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>wget http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/zero-install/injector-0.7.tar.gz.gpg</b>
</pre>

<p>
Check that the signature is correct using GPG. This also ensures that you have my key installed, which
you will need later!
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>gpg injector-0.7.tar.gz.gpg</b>
gpg: Signature made Wed 30 Mar 2005 16:24:02 BST using DSA key ID 59A53CC1
gpg: Good signature from "Thomas Leonard &lt;tal197@users.sourceforge.net&gt;"
</pre>

<p>
Extract the archive, become root, install the injector, and exit from root:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>tar xzf injector-0.7.tar.gz</b>
$ <b>cd injector-0.7</b>
$ <b>su</b>
[ enter root password ]
# <b>python setup.py install</b>
# <b>exit</b>
</pre>

<p>
You now have two new commands: <b>0launch</b>, which takes the URL of a program and runs it, and
<b>0alias</b>, which lets you use short names instead of URLs.
</p>

<h3>Running Edit with the injector</h3>

<p>
Run <b>0launch</b>, giving it the URL for the program you want to run, as shown below.
You will be prompted to confirm that you trust my GPG key.
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
Need to download; switching to GUI mode
Currently downloading:
- http://0install.net/2005/interfaces/injector-gui

Interface: http://0install.net/2005/interfaces/injector-gui
The interface is correctly signed with the following keys:
- Valid signature from 92429807C9853C0744A68B9AAE07828059A53CC1
Do you want to trust all of these keys to sign interfaces?
Trust all [Y/N]
</pre>

<p>
You should confirm that this is the fingerprint of my key and answer <b>Y</b>.
</p>

<div class='note'>TODO: This needs a better interface. At least, we should give the name as well as
the fingerprint.</div>

<p>
You might wonder why this confirmation is non-graphical. The reason is that the GUI interface is actually
a separate program and not included in the archive you downloaded above. <b>0launch</b> sees that you don't
yet have the GUI and starts by downloading it for you.
It was the attempt to fetch <b>0launch-gui</b> (and not <b>Edit</b>) which triggered the confirmation check. Having
answered <b>Y</b> and pressed Return, the required components of the injector are downloaded and unpacked:
</p>

<pre>

<p>
The injector selected suitable implementations of the two interfaces (<b>injector-gui</b>
version 0.3 and <b>injector</b> version 0.7). It then downloaded the archives
from sourceforge, unpacked them, checked that their signatures were correct,
and moved them into the cache directory.
</p>

<div class='note'>TODO: Archives are currently unpacked to your home directory, in
<b>~/.cache/0install.net/implementations</b>. In future, they will unpack to
a shared directory under <b>/var/cache</b>, using a setuid helper (which will
check the cryptographic digest first, of course).</div>

<p>
Once <b>0launch-gui</b> has been fetched, it displays this dialog box:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="545" height="325" src="edit-injector.png"
     alt="Running Edit with the injector" />
</p>

<p>
The main part of the window contains a list of all the components needed to run Edit.
At the top is Edit itself, and shown below is ROX-Lib, which Edit needs in order to function.
If you are happy with the selected versions, click on <b>Execute</b> to run the
program.
</p>

<p>
When you click on <b>Execute</b>, the injector will start downloading the two chosen
versions (this time showing the progress in a window, now the GUI is being used):
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="327" height="144" src="injector-downloading.png"
     alt="Downloading Edit and ROX-Lib" />
</p>

<p>
By default, the GUI confirmation box is only shown if the injector needs to download something.
If you run the command again once <b>Edit</b> has been cached, Edit will run immediately. To get back to
the dialog box, use the <b>--gui</b> option:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch --gui http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
</pre>

<h2>Creating an alias</h2>

<p>
It's annoying to have to keep typing in the full URL for Edit. The <b>0alias</b> command
can be used to create little shell scripts to start programs easily:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0alias rox-edit http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
Created script '/home/talex/bin/rox-edit'.
To edit policy: rox-edit --versions
(note: some shells require you to type 'rehash' now)
</pre>

<p>
The command puts the script in the first directory in your $PATH, which must therefore be
writable. You can now run edit like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>rox-edit</b>
</pre>

<p>
To get back to the policy box (so you can change which versions of Edit and
ROX-Lib you want used), run it like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>rox-edit --versions</b>
</pre>

<h2>Policy settings</h2>

<p>
You can affect which versions are chosen by changing your policy. Three aspects
of your policy are shown in the main window: <b>Network use</b>, <b>Freshness</b>
and <b>Help test new versions</b>. Click on <b>Help test new versions</b>, and
you may see the version numbers increase, as the injector chooses newer, less
well tested, versions. Note however that you may not see any change at all,
since there may not be new testing versions available when you try it.
</p>

<p>
To get the injector to notice that a new version is available, click on the <b>Refresh all now</b>
button (which fetches a fresh copy of each listed interface). You can also set the freshness
policy; the injector will automatically check for updates to interfaces that haven't been
checked within the allowed time.
</p>

<p>
These are not the only policy settings. The rest are per-component, and are
accessed by double-clicking on a line in the list. This is described in the following sections.
</p>

<p>Note that all changes to your policy are saved as soon as you make them.
Clicking on <b>Cancel</b> will close the window without running the program,
but any changes made to the policy are not reversed.
</p>


<h3>Choosing different versions</h3>

<p>
The interface URI (<b>http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>) is
used to get the default list of implementations. You can see the information
about an interface by double-clicking on it in the list of interfaces. For
example, double-clicking on <b>Edit</b> displays this dialog box:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
  <img width="627" height="345" src="edit-properties.png"
  	alt="Properties of the Edit interface" />
</p>

<p>
The information displayed is fetched from the interface file, which you can view in
a web browser if you're interested:
<a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit">Edit's interface</a>. This is
a plain-text GPG-signed file. The injector stores the downloaded interface files
locally (in <b>~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces</b>).
</p>

<h3>Stability</h3>

<p>
The interface file also gives a stability rating for each implementation. The following
levels are allowed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stable</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Developer</li>
<li>Buggy</li>
<li>Insecure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stability ratings are kept independently of the implementations, and are expected to change over
time. When any new release is made, its stability is initially set to <b>Testing</b>. If you
have selected <b>Help test new versions</b> then you will then start using it.
Otherwise, you will continue with the previous stable release. After a while
(days, weeks or months, depending on the project) with no serious problems
found, the author will change the implementation's stability to <b>Stable</b> so that
everyone will use it.
</p>

<p>
If problems are found, it will instead be marked as <b>Buggy</b>, or <b>Insecure</b>. The injector
won't select either by default, but it is useful to see the reason (you might opt to
continue using a buggy version if it works for you, but should never use an insecure
one). <b>Developer</b> is like a more extreme version of <b>Testing</b>, where the program is
expected to have bugs.
</p>

<p>
You can use the <b>Preferred Stability</b> setting in the interface dialog to choose which
versions to use. You can also change the stability rating of any implementation by clicking on it
and choosing a new rating from the popup menu. User-set ratings are shown in capitals.
</p>

<p>
As you make changes to the policy and ratings, the order of the implementations in the list
will change. The version at the top is the one that the injector will actually use. In addition
to the ratings above, you can set the rating to <b>Preferred</b>. Such versions always come first,
unless they're not cached and you are in Off-line mode.
</p>

<p>
Note: If you want to use the second item on the list because the first is
buggy, for example, then it is better to mark the first version as buggy than to mark the
second as preferred. This is because when a new version is available, you will want that to
become the version at the top of the list, whereas a preferred version will always be first.
