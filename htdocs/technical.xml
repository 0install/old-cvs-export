<h3>The glib library</h3>

<p>
Thought you might like to know that I now have a glib program compiling
and running from zero-install (glib is a common library used by GTK and
many other programs):
</p>

<pre>
$ cd /uri/http/zero-install.sf.net/demo
$ ./hello_glib
Hello World from glib!
</pre>

<p>
It compiles using the pkg-config .pc files under /uri (source is in CVS)
and runs from there too. So you don't need glib installed to compile it,
and you don't need it installed to run it :-)
</p>

<pre>
$ strace -e file ./hello_glib|&amp;grep -v ENOENT
execve("./hello_glib", ["./hello_glib"], [/* 23 vars */]) = 0
open("/uri/http/zero-install.sf.net/libs/glib/2.2.1/Linux-i386/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0", O_RDONLY) = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0555, st_size=1335762, ...}) = 0
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=73251, ...}) = 0
open("/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=1104040, ...}) = 0
open("/usr/lib/gconv/gconv-modules", O_RDONLY) = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=44467, ...}) = 0
fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFIFO|0600, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
Hello World from glib!
</pre>

<p>
The changes required were:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure glib with --prefix=/uri/.../glib/2.2.1/Linux-i386</li>
<li>Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to /uri/.../lib/pkgconfig directory containing .pc
files in Makefile.</li>
<li>Pass --rpath option to linker, giving /uri/.../lib directory.</li>
</ul>

<div class='note'>
I'm still trying to work out how to set NEEDED to the full path name, rather
than using rpath (which is rather slow, by comparison). Any linker gurus
out there?
</div>

<p>
Version 0.1.6 of zero-install also handles downloading using .tgz files
a directory at a time (so is much faster than before).
</p>
<p>
In fact, it's cleverer than that; you can decide how to group the files
within a directory between archives. The 0build script (which scans a
directory tree and builds all the indexes and archives) will automatically
put .DirIcon and AppInfo.xml files in one archive and everything else in
another. Thus, you can view a directory full of applications and you only
download what you need (AppInfo.xml is for the tool-tips).
