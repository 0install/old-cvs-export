<h3>Design and implementation details</h3>

<p>
You can find detailed design details in the
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/zero-install/zero-inst/Technical?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/plain">Technical</a> file
in CVS.

<h3>Tasks list</h3>

There is a list of current TODO items on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=76468">Task List</a>. Please 
<a href="support.html">let us know</a> if you want to help out with any of
these.

<h3>The glib library</h3>

<p>
Thought you might like to know that I now have a glib program compiling
and running from zero-install (glib is a common library used by GTK and
many other programs):
</p>

<pre>
$ cd /uri/0install/zero-install.sourceforge.net/demo
$ ./hello_glib
Hello World from glib!
</pre>

<p>
It compiles using the pkg-config .pc files under /uri (source is in CVS)
and runs from there too. So you don't need glib installed to compile it,
and you don't need it installed to run it :-)
</p>

<p>
The changes required were:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure glib with --prefix=/uri/.../glib/2.2.1/Linux-i386</li>
<li>Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to /uri/.../lib/pkgconfig directory containing .pc
files in Makefile.</li>
<li>Pass --rpath option to linker, giving /uri/.../lib directory.</li>
</ul>

<div class='note'>
For a better approach than using --rpath, see the
<tt>/uri/0install/zero-install.sourceforge.net/libs/libhello-1.0</tt>
example library, which changes the soname to an absolute path.
</div>

<p>
Version 0.1.6 of zero-install also handles downloading using .tgz files
a directory at a time (so is much faster than before).
</p>
<p>
In fact, it's cleverer than that; you can decide how to group the files
within a directory between archives. The 0build script (which scans a
directory tree and builds all the indexes and archives) will automatically
put .DirIcon and AppInfo.xml files in one archive and everything else in
another. Thus, you can view a directory full of applications and you only
download what you need (AppInfo.xml is for the tool-tips).
