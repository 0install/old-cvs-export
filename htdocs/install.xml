<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
Although the system makes installing other software very easy, the Zero
Install system itself still requires some work to install.
</p>

<div>Please DO NOT install this software on important machines. It is under
heavy developement and has not yet been well tested.</div>

<p>
That said, I'm running it on my machine without any problems so far. Please
let me know how you get on, and any problems you find.
</p>

<p>The Zero Install system requires a small Linux kernel module to provide
the /uri directory. Like all kernel modules, you <strong>must</strong>
compile this using the actual kernel headers for the kernel you're actually
running. In practice, this means that you should have compiled your own
kernel (eg, from <a href="http://kernel.org">kernel.org</a>) and be running
it. Using a stock distribution kernel is a bad idea. You may get a kernel
crash, and will probably have to reboot (this affects all kernel modules,
not just the zero-install one).
</p>


<p>
There are plenty of guides on the net if you don't feel confident about
compiling your own kernel. For example, 
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=2949">The Very Verbose Guide to Updating and Compiling Your Debian Kernel</a> and
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=443">Compiling the Linux Kernel</a>.
</p>

<p>OK, now <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zero-install/zero-inst-0.1.6.tgz">download Zero Install</a>. Extract it, and run
configure (things you type are shown in bold):</p>

<pre>
$ <b>tar xzf zero-inst-0.1.6.tgz</b>
$ <b>cd zero-inst-0.1.6</b>
$ <b>./configure</b>
creating cache ./config.cache
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... yes
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) is a cross-compiler... no
checking whether we are using GNU C... yes
checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
checking for directory with kernel source... /lib/modules/2.4.20/build
checking for kernel headers... OK
updating cache ./config.cache
creating ./config.status
creating Makefile
</pre>

<p>
If it doesn't work, it may tell you that it can't find the kernel headers.
You can use --with-kernel to tell it where they are, for example:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>./configure --with-kernel=/home/fred/linux-2.4.20</b>
</pre>

<p>
Then run make and install it (use su to get the root prompt, #):
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>make</b>
gcc [...] -o lazyfs.o lazyfs.c
$ <b>su</b>
# <b>make install</b>
mkdir -p /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs/lazyfs
cp lazyfs.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs/lazyfs/
depmod -a
[ -d /uri ] || mkdir /uri
[ -d /var/cache/zero-inst ] || mkdir /var/cache/zero-inst
</pre>

<p>
This will copy the new lazyfs module under /lib/modules/, and create the /uri
mount point and the /var/cache/zero-inst cache directory. The kernel
module can handle all cached requests itself, but when the user tries to
access something that isn't cached, it uses a 'helper' application to fetch
it. For security reasons, it's better not to run the helper as root. Change
the ownership of the cache directory to the user the helper will run as (either
your own user, or create a new user specially for the purpose using 'adduser').
</p>

<div style='text-align: left'>
<p>
If you're upgrading from a previous version, you may need to unload
the lazyfs module at this point:
</p>
<pre>
# <b>umount /uri</b>
# <b>rmmod lazyfs</b>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Run this command, replacing 'fred' with your login name, then mount /uri
(the order is important). Since the helper is not yet running, you won't
be able to access the directory yet, so don't worry about that.
</p>

<pre>
# <b>chown fred /var/cache/zero-inst</b>
# <b>mount lazyfs -t lazyfs /uri -o /var/cache/zero-inst</b>
</pre>

<p>
We don't need to be root anymore, so 'exit' from the 'su'. Now, run the
helper application (it will just wait, without doing anything):
</p>

<pre>
# <b>exit</b>
$ <b>./web-helper.py</b>
</pre>

<p>
The helper will print information about what it's doing when it's used.
Open another window, and try it out with the following command:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>cat /uri/http/zero-install.sf.net/demo/test.txt</b>
It worked!
</pre>

<p>
You can find some other programs to play with in the demo directory. For
example, you can open the <a href="http://rox.sf.net/rox_filer.php3">ROX-Filer</a> window shown on the main page using this command:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>rox /uri/http/zero-install.sf.net/demo</b>
</pre>

<p>
If you want /uri to be mounted automatically at boot-time, add this line
to the end of your /etc/fstab file:
</p>

<pre>
lazyfs  /uri  lazyfs  /var/cache/zero-inst  0 0
</pre>

<p>
You will then be able to use anything that's already cached. You still have
to start the helper application before you can fetch new stuff.
