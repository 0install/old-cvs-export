<h3>Explaination of features</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>Users can install software</dt>		
 <dd>A user without root privileges can install software using this system (without unreasonable extra effort).</dd>
 
 <dt>Dependencies handled automatically</dt>	
 <dd>If a program requires some library to function, the system will locate, download and install the library too.</dd>

 <dt>Automatic upgrading</dt>			
 <dd>The system can check for and install upgrades automatically or at the operators's request. User does not have to
 perform a full install operation manually on each package.</dd>
 
 <dt>Libraries shared between programs</dt>
 <dd>If two programs use the same library, the library is only downloaded and stored once. Upgrading a library will
 benefit all programs that use it.</dd>
 
 <dt>Downloads shared between users</dt>		
 <dd>If two users install/use the same program, it is only downloaded once and stored once.</dd>
 
 <dt>Multiple versions coexist</dt>
 <dd>Two versions of a program or library can be installed at the same time, and the user can choose which one to run.</dd>

 <dt>Uninstall</dt>
 <dd>Programs can be cleanly removed from the system easily (reversing the effects of the install).</dd>
 
 <dt>Signatures</dt>				
 <dd>Software comes with a digital signature, which is checked automatically by the system.<br/>
 Notes: The Zero Install filesystem remembers the signing key when software is
 first accessed, and checks that it hasn't changed when upgrading. The injector
 prompts the user even on the first access. Java Web-Start requires all components to be signed with the
 same key.</dd>
 
 <dt>Conflict-free</dt>
 <dd>If program A requires an old version of a library, and program B requires a new version, A and B can both be installed and
 used at the same time. The system will never refuse to install one program because some other program is installed.</dd>
 
 <dt>Decentralised</dt>
 <dd>A program packages for this system can be installed easily, without having to be in some special centralised repository.<br/>
 Notes: Debian allows extra repositories to be added, but this is a manual step and a considerable security risk.</dd>
 
 <dt>Non-root install of system</dt>		
 <dd>The packaging system itself can be easily installed without administrator privileges, and the normal selection of
 software will be available.</dd>

 <dt>All programming languages</dt>			
 <dd>All types of program can be accessed using this system.</dd>
