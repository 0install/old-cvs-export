  <name>Injector</name>
  <summary>Chooses software components to run programs</summary>
  <description>
A program is made up of many different components, typically written by
different groups of people. Each component is available in multiple versions.
The injector is used when starting a program. Its job is to decide which
implementation of each required component to use.

An interface describes what a component does. The injector starts with the
interface for the program you want to run (like 'The Gimp') and chooses an
implementation (like 'The Gimp 2.2.0'). However, this implementation will in
turn depend on other interfaces, such as 'GTK' (which draws the menus and
buttons). Thus, the injector must choose implementations of each dependancy
(each of which may require further interfaces, and so on).
