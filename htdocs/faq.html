<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds really complicated</h3>
<p>It isn't. Try it. Now.</p>

<h3>Why are you abandoning application directories after supporting
them all these years?</h3>
<p>I'm not. This system is built on application directories. It would
never work without them. You didn't try it out, did you?</p>

<h3>Isn't fetching stuff over the web really slow?</h3>
<p>You have to get stuff over the web anyway the first time. The
system caches everything, and will never even check that the cache is
up-to-date if it can satisfy a request without updating.
</p><p>
There is effectively no speed hit to using stuff once it's downloaded.
The fact that everything is referenced by fixed URIs instead of
having to search means that this system can actually be faster in some
cases. Consider loading a shared library. At the moment, a program
must, on startup:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Load /etc/ld.so.cache and find the full path of each library from
that.</li>
 <li>Load the actual library by it's path.</li>
</ol>

<p>With Zero-installation, this becomes:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Load the actual library by it's path.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It also removes the need to run ldconfig at install time (handy,
since there is no 'install time' ;-), losing a major source of errors
and user confusion.
</p>
<p>
As far as network bandwidth goes, the worst-case situation is that you
downloaded the entire archive, which is what you'd have had to do
anyway. However, by default each file is downloaded on demand. Thus,
if you want to run a ROX-Lib2 application like Archive, but you don't
want to read the ROX-Lib2 developer reference documentation then it
doesn't get downloaded (until you try to access it).
</p>

<h3>What about people without internet connections?</h3>
<p>You can still install from CD. Either install an application in the
normal AppDir fashion (ie, by dragging to your home directory), or by
providing a web-cache on the CD and merging it with the master one (we
could provide software to do this easily).
</p>

<h3>This is just a network filesystem, isn't it?</h3>
<p>Yes. It's currently using HTTP because pretty much everyone can put
stuff on a webserver, whereas it's often hard to find someone who will
host other types of server. The scheme can use other methods if
required.</p>
<p>The main difference between this and standard shares is the way the
paths use the internet DNS system. This allows us to link to resources
by fixed paths, in the same way that I can put up a link to
<a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net">ROX</a> on this web page without
worrying about where the user has 'installed' the web page.
</p>

<h3>Isn't is really hard to find applications if you always have to
type URIs for them?</h3>
<p>Yes. As with the web, that works but it's not the intended way to
do it. Like the web, you have links to the URIs, and you use the links
normally.</p>
<p>
For example, having opened the ROX-Filer directory showing Archive in
the walk-through above, you can drag Archive from the window onto your
panel. Now you access it by dragging things to compress to the panel
icon as usual; no URIs.
</p><p>
You could also put it on the pinboard, bookmark the directory, add
Archive to your Send To menu, or whatever. Web pages can provide the
URIs in a clickable form (so clicking on a link opens the filer
window). A 'distribution' could be nothing more than a web page
listing links to high quality software for a particular audience.
</p><p>
Finally, if you want to get a newer version, or find related software,
traditional systems mean you have to try and remember where you got it
from, or hunt through the documentation. With the URI scheme, just
select 'Show Location' from the panel menu and the directory
containing Archive (on the remote server) will be opened.
</p>

<h3>What about dial-up users? They don't want on-demand loading when
they're off-line.</h3>

<p>Various levels of granularity can be used. A user could tell the
system to cache an entire application, for example. Of course, dial-up
users might also appreciate that they have to download a lot less
stuff in total. A user with a slow, but easy to start, internet
connection will probably prefer this scheme. A user who wants to take
their laptop up a mountain, however, would probably want to get as
much software as possible first.
</p><p>
However, knowing
how much to download requires knowing what software the user may want
to run in the future. Even the user doesn't know that. It's not a new
problem. No modern system is 'closed'. There will always be an
application that says "This program works well with 'foo'. You can get
it from this web site...". Should installing the program also install
'foo'? Should installing ROX-Lib also install the README? The
developer documentation? The python tutorial at python.org?
</p>

<h3>I understand that when I browse the web my computer caches the
pages, images and stylesheets automatically so I don't need to
manually 'install' multiple PNG images to see a page, but software is
different!</h3>
<p>Why?</p>

<h3>Isn't this like Windows Update?</h3>
<p>From what I've heard, that's something completely different. That
tells you when something needs upgrading (which this scheme doesn't
do) and then does a traditional download-unpack-setup.</p>

<h3>What about when resources move?</h3>
<p>Everything you've already accessed at least once will continue to
work. Users trying software for the first time will find that it
doesn't work due to broken links. This is not new, either. The download
instructions for ROX-Filer tell users that they need to get GTK from
www.gtk.org and libxml from www.xmlsoft.org. If those sites change
their names, the download instructions will be broken. It really
doesn't make any
difference.
</p><p>
As with the regular web, people can leave redirections to the new
site. Users will also be able to specify a list of redirections
manually if required (this also allows all access to a particular
library to use the user's modified version, for example).
</p>

<h3>How secure is this?</h3>
<p>About as secure as any system which ultimately involves running
software written by people you don't know who live in far away
countries. However, since the downloading is automatic, there are more
chances for automatic checking (eg, verifying GPG signatures, etc).
</p>
<p>
To be more precise, it has all the advantages of application
directories (no install step, so no chance for anything to run as
root). In addition, if two users try to run the same application, they
both automatically get the same cached copy, whereas without this each
would have to install a separate copy to their home directory, or one
user has to trust the other user not to have modified his copy, and
use that.
</p>

<h3>Apps will run very slowly on the first load... users might think
they've crashed</h3>

<p>The system can provide a visual indication that software is being
downloaded. Eg, a small box appears at the bottom of the screen saying
"Fetching resources from www.gimp.org. Please wait..." when the Gimp
is run for the first time. This can have progress bars, and maybe even
a cancel button (the system knows which user triggered the download).</p>

<h3>How do you do integration (eg, making a Start menu show all
installed software)?</h3>

<p>Since there is no concept of software being 'installed' or
'not-installed', this is not required. The menu (or other launching
device) simply shows applications that the user may want to run. They
will be fetched on demand.</p>
<p>For example, the set of applications your system shows you on first
install is the applications the distribution author thinks you might
like. They may be already in the cache, or they may be loaded on
demand (depending on the distribution's installer).
</p>
<p>Indeed, the question is backwards. The menu doesn't show installed
software; rather, the 'installed' software is what the user has put on
the menu.
</p>

<h3>What if something gets automatically removed from the cache while
I'm up a mountain with my laptop?</h3>
<p>Currently, nothing is ever automatically removed from the cache.
Users can choose the purging scheme that suits them. For users with
broadband, that might mean removing anything that hasn't been accessed
for a year. For users with dial-up and 80Gb disks, that probably means
never ever removing anything.
</p><p>
Possibly, running gimp-1.2.3 could check for, and offer to remove,
gimp-1.2.2, etc. It would also be possible to start from the user's
list of applications (menu, panel, etc) and see which resources in the
cache were 'reachable' and offer to delete any that weren't.
</p>

<h3>How do I link against a library such that when it's upgraded I get
the new version automatically?</h3>

<p>Link against .../libfoo/latest-1.2.x. This is a symlink to, eg
libfoo/1.2.3. If the user enters the 'libfoo' directory and does a
refresh, the link will now point to 1.2.4 and that will be fetched on
demand.</p>
<p>
If a program relies on a bugfix in libfoo-1.2.6 then it can check that
'latest-1.2.x' points to that version or later, and force a refresh if
not.
