<h1>The Zero Install system</h1>
<p class='author'>Thomas Leonard &lt;tal197 at users.sf.net&gt;, 2003</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class='q'>What is it?</p>

<p>
The Zero Install system makes software installation not merely
easy, but unnecessary. Users run their applications directly from the
internet from the software author's pages. Caching makes this as fast
as running a normal application after the first time, and allows
off-line use.
</p>

<p class='q'>Show me an example.</p>

<p>
Let's say you're looking for a little desktop reminder application. You
search <a href="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat.net</a> and find
<a href="http://rox.sf.net/memo.php3">Memo</a>. You open the directory
containing Memo (on the remote machine) with your file manager (note the
titlebar):
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img src='memo.png' width='343' height='130'
     alt='ROX-Filer window showing Memo application on the remote machine' />
</p>

<p>
Click on Memo to run it, and it will run. Now, Memo depends on ROX-Lib2,
which requires pygtk, with needs python2.2 and GTK+-2, which needs glib,
pango, AKT and pkg-config. But that's OK; Memo runs everything it
needs directly from the remote machines where they're stored.
</p>

<p>
The first time you ran Memo, a progress indicator appeared showing the
download progress. If you quit it and run it again, it will start instantly,
because the Zero Install system has cached everything locally.
</p>

<p class='q'>What about package management systems like APT?</p>

<p>
These require a central authority to maintain the database. For example, you
can't install Memo using APT, because Debian don't package it. The best an
author can do is provide Debian .deb packages on the site. But then the user
still has to do the manual dependancy resolution above for everything not in
Debian's system.
</p><p>
Also, a user installing from a .deb, .rpm, etc still has to enter the root
password and run a script as root. This is inconvenient and a security risk.
Zero Install allows uses to run software without root privileges.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="compare.html">comparison with other systems</a> document
for a more detailed list of the advantages of Zero Install.
</p>

<p class='q'>Can I try it out?</p>

<p>
Although the system makes installing other software very easy, the Zero
Install system itself still requires some work to install. Please read this:
