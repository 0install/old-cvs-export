<h2>Comparison with other systems</h2>

<table>
<tr><th>Traditional method</th><th>Using Zero Install</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<ol>
 <li>Download memo-version.tgz onto your machine.</li>
 <li>Extract it (tar xzf memo-version.tgz, or use a GUI archiver).</li>
 <li>Enter the root password and put it in the desired location (eg, move it
to /usr/local/apps, or run 'make install' for non application-directory apps).</li>
 <li>Run it. You get an error about needing python 2.2.</li>
 <li>Visit <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a> and download
python 2.2.</li>
 <li>Extract the archive, enter the root password and install.</li>
 <li>Run Memo again. You need <a href="http://rox.sf.net/rox_lib.php3">ROX-Lib2</a>.</li>
 <li>Download that, extract and install.</li>
 <li>Run Memo again. Now you need
<a href="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/python/v2.0/">pygtk2</a>.</li>
 <li>Download pygtk, extract, enter the root password and install.</li>
 <li>Pygtk2 requires GTK+-2.0.</li>
 <li>Visit <a href="http://www.gtk.org">www.gtk.org</a> and fetch GTK,
GLib, Pango, pkg-config and AKT. Install all of them.</li>
 <li>Memo will now run.</li>
 <li>To make it easier to get to in future, drag it onto your panel.</li>
</ol>
</td><td>
<ol>
<li>Open a filer window showing Memo on the remote machine.</li>
<li>Click on it to run it.</li>
<li>To make it easier to get to in future, drag it onto your panel.</li>

<p class='q'>What about package management systems like APT?</p>

<p>
A user installing from a .deb, .rpm, etc still has to enter the root
password and run a script as root. This is inconvenient and a security risk.
Zero Install allows uses to run software without root privileges.
</p>

<p>
The basic problem is: software authors want to put their software on
their web site and let users easily get it and run it. Software is
generally distributed in a variety of formats under Linux:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source tarballs</dt>
<dd>Installing from a source tarball typically requires:
  <ol>
   <li>Downloading an archive</li>
   <li>Extracting the archive</li>
   <li>Running ./configure; make</li>
   <li>Fetching any libraries this software requires and performing
this whole sequence on each one, recursively.</li>
   <li>Entering the root password</li>
   <li>Running make install</li>
  </ol>
<p>
If installed to a system-wide location (so that other users can use
the program easily) then the install step must typically be done as
'root', making this method of installation a major security risk (if
the software is just normal application software, such as a word
processor, which doesn't otherwise require root privileges).
</p>
<p>
If installed to the user's home directory then the user must do all
the above, except:
</p>
 <ul>
  <li>They don't have to enter the root password.</li>
  <li>They must choose a location for all the files, cluttering their
home directories.</li>
  <li>They must edit their PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, MANPATH and similar
environment variables.</li>
 </ul>
<p>
Uninstallation can also be rather tricky, depending on how well the
author has tested it.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Binary tarballs</dt>
<dd>These are similar to source tarballs, except:
  <ul>
    <li>You don't need a compiler.</li>
    <li>You often need to have exactly the same library versions as the
person who made the binary.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>RPMs, Debs, etc</dt>
<dd>Similar to binary tarballs, but your system has to match a
particular well-known system (eg, RedHat 8.0) rather than whatever the
developer is using. Generally they can't be shared across
distributions, although alien tries to help with this.
</dd>

<dt>ROX application directories</dt>
<dd>These packages only need to be unpacked; there is no install step
and so security is better. They can also be installed by users without
modifying environment variables. However, they are still not shared
automatically between users, and users must install libraries
manually.
</dd>

<dt>apt-get, and similar</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This uses packages such as Debs (see above) but handles dependancies
by automatically installing the packages that it depends upon.
</p>
<p>
This requires a central authority to produce the packages. If the user
wants to use a third-party product, they must edit their sources.list
file and refresh their database. Such packages often become
out-of-date quickly.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
All the above methods are either a lot of work, or run the install
(unnecessarily) as root.
