<h2>Documentation layout</h2>

<p>
This section describes Zero Install in general rather than giving details specific to either of the implementations.
If you want help using one of them, jump to that section instead:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href='injector.html'>The Injector</a></dt>
<dd>The injector is a pure Python implementation of Zero Install. It provides the <b>0launch</b> command, and
can be installed by anyone.
</dd>

<dt><a href='filesystem.html'>The /uri/0install filesystem</a></dt>
<dd>
The filesystem uses a kernel module to provide the <b>/uri/0install</b> filesystem. This only works on Linux, and
you need to be root to install it (but once installed other software can be fetched by non-root users).
</dd>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
Let's expand a little on the goals set out on the <a href='index.html'>title page</a>:
</p>

<dl class='spaced'>
 <dt>Anyone can install software</dt>
 <dd>You don't have to be root just to install a word-processor. Most packaging systems only allow the root
 user to install software using the packaging system's automatic downloading and dependency handling. Other users
 must often install from source or handle dependencies themselves. Zero Install allows any user to get a program
 and its dependencies onto the machine and running.</dd>

 <dt>Anyone can distribute software</dt>
 <dd>One of the more frustrating aspects of open source software is finding a
 program you want, only to discover that there is no package available for your
 distribution. You don't need to be blessed by a distribution (or anyone else)
 to be part of Zero Install; all you need is a web page.</dd>

 <dt>It doesn't matter whether software is installed or not</dt>
 <dd>Traditional systems make running software a two-step process: first you
 install it, then you run it.  In a Zero Install system, you just run it and
 the system handles the rest (downloading and caching as needed). You can delete
 the downloaded programs later to save space, and they will be fetched again
 automatically if they are needed in the future.</dd>

 <dt>Downloads are shared</dt>
 <dd>If one user installs a 20 Mb application, another user can run it without downloading it again.
 Most packaging systems solve this problem by only allowing root to install software. The systems which
 don't have this limitation (eg, <a href='http://autopackage.org'>autopackage</a>) typically end up downloading
 and storing multiple copies of a program; one for each user. Zero Install
 shares downloads (safely) between users.
 </dd>

 <dt>Users don't need to trust each other</dt>
 <dd>In traditional systems, installing a program also puts files into shared directories like <b>/usr/bin</b>
 and <b>/usr/lib</b> under short names. So if one user installs the Gimp from <b>http://evil.com</b> then it
 might save the executable as <b>/usr/bin/gimp</b>. Another user might run this, thinking it was from
 <a href='http://gimp.org'>http://gimp.org</a>. In a Zero Install system, users specify the full URI of
 the program they want to run, and the system only shares the copy if they really are the same. The short-cuts
 are per-user rather than the programs.</dd>
