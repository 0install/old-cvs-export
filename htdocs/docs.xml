<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
The documentation is split into four parts, for the different
types of reader we have:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>User</dt>
<dd>Runs software using Zero Install.</dd>

<dt>Admin</dt>
<dd>Sets up zero install for users.</dd>

<dt>Packager</dt>
<dd>Makes software available to others via Zero Install.</dd>

<dt>Zero Install developer</dt>
<dd>Helps write the core Zero Install system.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Everyone is encouraged to subscribe to the
<a href="support.html">mailing list</a> and talk about any issues related to
Zero Install.</p>

<h2>Documentation for users</h2>

<p>
Generally, you don't have to do anything special to use the system.
When you find software on the web which is available via zero install, you'll
be told where it is, and you can run it from there. For example, you can run
the glib `Hello World' demo like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>cd /uri/http/zero-install.sourceforge.net/demo</b>
$ <b>./hello_glib</b>
Hello World from glib!
</pre>

<p>
To make it easier to find it in future, you should bookmark it somehow.
Some possibilities are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Open a filer window and drag the program onto the pinboard or panel,
or add a filer bookmark.
</li>

<li>Add it to a Start menu or other launcher program.</li>

<li>Symlink it into your path, eg (assuming PATH contains ~/bin):
<pre>
$ <b>ln -s /uri/http/zero-install.sourceforge.net/demo/hello_glib ~/bin</b>
$ <b>hello_glib</b>
Hello World from glib!
</pre>
</li>

<li>Make a shell alias:
<pre>
$ <b>alias hw='/uri/http/zero-install.sourceforge.net/demo/hello_glib'</b>
$ <b>hw</b>
Hello World from glib!
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
There should never be any need to worry about libraries and supporting
programs, because they are all accessed automatically through the cache.
However, you have two further programs to help you interact with the cache:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>0show</dt>
<dd>This command displays a list of your current downloads. The display
updates automatically as the list changes. The idea is to turn this into
a system tray applet so that if a program suddenly stops responding because
you've accessed a new feature (such as 'Edit image with Gimp' when Gimp
isn't cached yet) you can see what's going on.</dd>

<dt>0refresh</dt>
<dd>For speed reasons, the cache is never automatically updated. If you
know that gimp2.0 is available, but /uri/http/www.gimp.org only has a gimp1.3
subdirectory then you can run 0refresh to update it:
<pre>
$ <b>cd /uri/http/www.gimp.org</b>
$ <b>ls</b>
gimp1.2
gimp1.3
$ <b>0refresh</b>
$ <b>ls</b>
gimp1.2
gimp1.3
gimp2.0
</pre>

(this command does not exist yet; in the meantime, deleting
/var/cache/zero-inst/http/www.gimp.org will have the same effect)
</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Documentation for admins</h2>

<p>Setting up a computer so that it can use Zero Install is covered in
detail in the <a href="install.html">Install Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation for packagers</h2>

<p>If you'd like to make software available via Zero Install then you should
use the 0build program to build the index file. The easiest way to do this
is to put your programs inside a directory called 'www' and use 0build
to build the index files in the server directory from there:</p>

<pre>
$ <b>ls -l ~/www/MyProg</b>
total 4
-rwxr-xr-x    1 tal00r   tal00r         18 2003-05-23 15:21 foo
$ <b>~/www/MyProg/foo</b>
42
$ <b>0build /var/www</b>
Building index file in www
Listing www ...
Building index file in www/MyProg
Listing www/MyProg ...
$ <b>/uri/http/localhost/MyProg/foo</b>
42
</pre>

<p>And that's it! Of course, when giving the address to other people, you'll
have to replace 'localhost' with your webserver's host name.</p>
