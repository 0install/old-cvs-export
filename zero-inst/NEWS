Changes since 0.1.10:

* There is now one index file per site, not one per directory.

* Sometimes when a download finished, 0show wasn't notified.

* Added a test system.

* Use RELAX NG to validate XML files.

* Lazyfs improvements:

	- Better diagnostics.

	- Should be better at detecting incompatible kernel versions.

	- Replaced old buggy readdir routine with generic dcache version.

	- Used to BUG if the helper released a dentry that noone else was
	  using.

* Use libxml instead of libexpat for XML parsing.

* Helper doesn't pass request handles to child (wget) processes, so they
  get closed at the right time.

* Scheme name is now '0http', not 'http'.

* New 'task' abstraction handles dependancies between tasks better (eg,
  a file request depends on an index fetch followed by an archive fetch).

* Push updates to 0show-type clients at next poll, not each time something
  changes.

Changes since 0.1.9:

* Lots of changes to the build process and layout:

  - Linux subdirectory with Linux-specific bits.
  - Uses automake.
  - 'make install' target unloads old module an unmounts /uri
  - 'make uninstall' removes entry from fstab
  - 0show, 0refresh and zero-install binaries are installed
  - 0build has been moved out -- it is now provided via zero-install itself

* Zero-install now uses cached index files without refetching if they
  were downloaded less than five minutes ago.

* Fix permissions on control socket (0show and 0refresh didn't work for
  anyone except the zero install user).

Changes since 0.1.8:

* Change to the control interface: lines are now terminated by \0, not \n.

* 0show interface changed to include the path of the current download and
  its total size (if known). This is for progress indicators.

* Index files are validated more carefully.

* The code has been tidied up a great deal.

* When fetching a file, the index is updated first.

* Installation is now simpler.

* Initial (untested) support for Linux 2.5.70.

* Kernel module checks that size and mtimes are correct, and does a
  refresh if not.

Changes since 0.1.7:

* New 0refresh program to update the cache.

* Helper can read commands from clients (0refresh, 0show).

* New /uri/.lazyfs-cache/ symlink, so cache location isn't hard-coded anymore.

* A symlink with the 'magic' target '@PLATFORM@' gets the current platform
  type as its target.

* Kernel modules compile with optimisations (Dan Egnor).

* Fix typo in locking (prevented compiling on SMP machines).


Changes since 0.1.6:

* 0build script now creates the output in a different directory, and gives
  the size and MD5 sum of each archive.

* LazyFS kernel modules:

  - Sends one request per user per file, so the helper can track who wants each
    file and cancel requests on a per-user basis.

  - Fixed a potentially nasty referencing problem with mmapped files.

  - Support poll() for helper pipe.

* Helper:

  - Complete rewrite in C.

  - Now handles multiple downloads in parallel.

  - Clients can connect to helper to check on current downloads.

* New 0show connects to helper and keeps user updated on current downloads.
